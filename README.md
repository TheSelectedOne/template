#### What do i have to do before starting?

1. Install node modules on client and server side.
2. Install pgadmin if you don't have it.
3. use SQL shell to create a new database.
4. Use Docker to install Redis.
5. update your .env file on the server side (example .env file is given)
6. create cert folder in servers root folder and inside there add your generated SSL key and cert. (google if you don't know how)

-   if you have any questions or i forgot something to add here then please let me know.

### Why?

Because I got tired of repeating the same thing.
Everytime I started a project i would spend time on authentication as most of my projects i have done required me to have it.
Now I can use that time to actually build the main part of whatever the next project is going to be.

It is good to use this template for an easy start with your web app projects.

-   If you see that something could be done better or something is way off then let me know and i will update it.
